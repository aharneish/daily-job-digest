## üìß Enhanced Email Features

The digest email now includes:
- **Filter Summary**: Applied criteria and statistics
- **Source Breakdown**: Jobs from each platform
- **Job Quality Metrics**: High/medium/low relevance breakdown
- **Top Skills Analysis**: Most demanded skills
- **Top Matches**: Best 5 jobs with detailed info
- **Complete CSV Export**: All jobs with metadata

## Automation

The workflow `.github/workflows/daily-job.yml` runs the job daily at 06:30 UTC and can be triggered manually. It sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs the enhanced script with web search.

## Docker

To build and run the project in a container:
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.dockerfile -t enhanced-job-digest .
docker run --env-file .env enhanced-job-digest
```

## üîß Performance & Rate Limiting

- Built-in rate limiting to respect website policies
- Duplicate detection across all sources
- Efficient caching to avoid re-processing same URLs
- Configurable result limits per search query
- Error handling for failed requests

## üìä Output Formats

- **Email Digest**: Rich HTML email with analytics
- **CSV Export**: Detailed spreadsheet with all job data
- **Console Logs**: Real-time progress and statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Web Search Issues
- If web search fails, the script continues with Indeed/LinkedIn
- Rate limiting may cause delays - this is normal
- Some job portals may block automated access - the script handles this gracefully

### Email Issues
- Ensure Gmail App Password is correctly set
- Check spam folder for digest emails
- Verify `GMAIL_USER` and `TO_EMAIL` are correct

### LinkedIn Issues
- LinkedIn cookie may expire - refresh it periodically
- LinkedIn scraping is optional and can be disabled

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for improvements. The enhanced script is designed to be modular and extensible.

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

- Respects robots.txt and rate limiting
- Uses public job posting data only
- Implements delays to avoid overwhelming servers
- Follows web scraping best practices
